- **Resources**: Tools (e.g., Jira, TestRail), environments, and team roles.
- **Schedule**: Timeline for test planning, execution, and reporting.
- **Deliverables**: Test cases, defect logs, and test summary reports.

The test plan is available in `/docs/test-plan.md`.

## Test Cases
The **Test Cases** are organized by feature or module and include:
- **Test Case ID**: Unique identifier for each test.
- **Objective**: Purpose of the test case.
- **Preconditions**: Required setup or conditions.
- **Test Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for execution.
- **Expected Results**: Criteria for determining pass or fail.
- **Status**: Pass, fail, or not executed.

Test cases are stored in the `/test-cases/` directory, with subfolders for each module or feature.
