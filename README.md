# SoftwareTestingProjects
Maunal Testing Project:-This repository contains documentation and resources related to Manual Testing, including a comprehensive Test Plan, detailed Test Cases, and structured approaches to test execution and reporting. It is designed for QA teams, testers, or developers aiming to ensure product quality through systematic manual testing practices.

Manual Testing Project for [Application Name]
Project Overview
This repository encapsulates a robust manual testing initiative for [Application Name, e.g., an e-commerce platform], designed to ensure functional integrity, usability, and cross-platform compatibility. As a QA Lead, I’ve structured this project to reflect industry-standard practices, providing detailed test artifacts to validate critical features, streamline defect management, and deliver actionable insights for development teams.
Testing Objectives

Functional Validation: Verify core functionalities such as [e.g., user authentication, product catalog navigation, payment processing].
Usability Assurance: Ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience across diverse user personas.
Compatibility Testing: Validate performance across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), devices (desktop, mobile), and operating systems (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android).
Regression Testing: Confirm stability post-bug fixes and feature updates.
Defect Management: Document and prioritize defects to facilitate efficient resolution.

Key Artifacts

Test Plan: Outlines testing scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and risk mitigation strategies.
Test Cases: Comprehensive, traceable test cases with test IDs, preconditions, steps, expected results, and actual outcomes. Covers positive, negative, and edge cases.
Test Scenarios: High-level scenarios mapping to business requirements for end-to-end testing.
Bug Reports: Standardized reports including defect description, severity, priority, screenshots, logs, and steps to reproduce.
Mindmaps: Visual aids for test planning and coverage analysis.
Test Metrics: KPIs such as test coverage (%), defect density, pass/fail rates, and execution time.

Tools and Technologies

Test Management: TestRail for test case management and execution tracking.
Defect Tracking: Jira for logging, prioritizing, and tracking defects.
Documentation: Markdown for artifact creation; Confluence for team collaboration.
Browser Tools: Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools for debugging UI issues.
Optional: Postman for manual API testing (if applicable).

Getting Started

Set Up Environment:
Ensure access to the application under test ([e.g., provide staging URL or setup instructions]).
Install required tools (e.g., TestRail, Jira, or browser extensions).


Review Artifacts:
Start with /docs/test-plan to understand the testing strategy.
Explore /docs/test-cases for detailed test scripts.


Execute Tests:
Follow test cases in /docs/test-cases to validate features.
Log results (pass/fail) and update execution status in TestRail or Excel.


Report Defects:
Use templates in /templates/bug-report.md to document issues.
File defects in Jira or GitHub Issues with clear repro steps.


Generate Reports:
Update /docs/reports with test execution summaries and metrics.



Prerequisites

Familiarity with manual testing methodologies (functional, usability, regression).
Access to the application’s staging or testing environment.
Basic knowledge of defect tracking tools (Jira, GitHub Issues).
Understanding of browser developer tools for UI/functional validation.



Best Practices 

Traceability: Link test cases to requirements for full coverage.
Clarity: Write concise, actionable test steps and defect reports.
Prioritization: Focus on high-risk areas (e.g., payment flows, user data handling).
Collaboration: Engage developers early during defect triage to reduce resolution time.
Metrics-Driven: Use test metrics to guide testing efforts and report progress to stakeholders.
